# bookmarks

## A bookmark site made for fun and to replace browser statup pages.

  Did not include my own personal links and that junk. Not a lot of comments. Has a simple jquery script to toggle display on the tabs to show/hide the section children, and same script shows/hides the ul children. Didn't go far enough to hide others on opening a different section/ul. 

### Plan to change list:

1. Sass
    * Really just use this project to try out breaking up my css into smaller bits and have various modules

2. Bottom Aligned
    * Want should to be bottom aligned with the viewport and document, so that when the expanding menus expand, they eat up the space between it and the bottom aligned element. I also don't want a ton of space to just be between bottom aligned element and the expanding menus because it looks dumb. Tried abosulte positioning, and a filler div won't do well because it will always look dumb when used. 

    * For my personal one, I've decided to just use more space by putting the space inbetween category containers. Works well enough, still might look into fixed position on should for an easier time all around and to make it look just nicer I guess.
