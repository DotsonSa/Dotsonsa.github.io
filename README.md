#bookmarks
  A bookmark site made for fun and to replace browser statup pages.

  Did not include my own personal links and that junk. Not a lot of comments. Has a simple jquery script to toggle display on the tabs to show/hide the section children, and same script shows/hides the ul children. Didn't go far enough to hide others on opening a different section/ul.
