# bookmarks

## A bookmark site made for fun and to replace browser statup pages.

  Did not include my own personal links and that junk. Not a lot of comments. Has a simple jquery script to toggle display on the tabs to show/hide the section children, and same script shows/hides the ul children. Didn't go far enough to hide others on opening a different section/ul. 

### Plan to change list:

1. colors
    * Change colors up with light colors besides terrible gray/white/black, and probably increase margins because it's simple

2. jQuery
    * Mess around so only one section opened, and only one bookmark list is open


3. Sass
    * Really just use this project to try out breaking up my css into smaller bits and have various modules
